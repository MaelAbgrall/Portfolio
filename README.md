# React-Portfolio
This multipage React / static website is for photographer who want a free & easy to update portfolio.
You can use it with any picture host, and my examples are using imgur.
The project help you building a website hosted on github, if you're not using it, you should take a look at links and change them accordingly (same case if you're using a custom DNS)

Please note that the following guide is intended for a beginner / someone without any knowledge in programming

# Required knowledge
You need at least basics of html. All the project has comments to indicate you what you need to update !
You can find an excellent course / ressource [here, at W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

This is better if you also know basics of JavaScript, and best if you also know React.

# CSS
Don't worry about it, I'm using [Bootstrap 4 Beta](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Please update the CDN link if needed

I'm using .. for icons
